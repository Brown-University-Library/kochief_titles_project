### about

The kochief_titles project started in 2010. It was an early experimentation by a previous programmer with using the software package '[kochief](https://github.com/gsf/kochief)' to relatively easily create a web presentation of newly-cataloged [Brown University Library](https://library.brown.edu) titles, with search and [faceting](http://www.webdesignpractices.com/navigation/facets.html) features.
